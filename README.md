# factory_pattern_example

The Factory pattern is a creative design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes. This allows you to delegate the creation of objects to specific subclasses or functions.

This pattern is useful when you need to instantiate different types of objects according to certain conditions.

This program implements the Factory pattern to create different types of products.
